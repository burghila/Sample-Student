# Abstract Class Demonstration in C#

## Overview
This simple C# console application demonstrates the use of abstract classes and inheritance. It includes an abstract class `Person` and a derived class `Employee`. The application creates an instance of `Employee`, sets its properties, and calls a method to display the name.

## Features
- **Abstract Class (`Person`)**: Defines a template for other classes with a method `SayName()`.
- **Inherited Class (`Employee`)**: Implements the abstract method `SayName()` from the `Person` class.

## Getting Started
To run this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or any compatible IDE.
3. Build and run the application.

## Usage
The application will automatically create an instance of `Employee` with predefined values and display the name in the console window. Simply execute the program to see the output.
